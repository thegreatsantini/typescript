1. Open folder in Visual Studio Code

2. Look at the errors you get for the implicitly typed variables

3. Understand that TypeScript can't infer the type if you split up
   declaration and assigment

4. Play around with the noEmitOnError-compiler option:
   When true:  Call "tsc" and NO "main.js" is generated
   Otherwise: Call "tsc" and "main.js" is generated
